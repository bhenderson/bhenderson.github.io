I wanted to start cateloging my profesional learnings and understandings. I should have started this when I was younger. I also hope to see how my opinions have changed over time.

## Technical Debt
[Great video](https://youtu.be/pqeJFYwnkjE) from the coiner of the term. It is a metaphor, and it was coined writing financial software. It was used because management would understand the term.
> you can borrow money, but if you never pay it back, eventually all your income goes to interest and your purchasing power goes to $0.
Technical debt is better understood as the cost of writing software due to a lack of understanding. Not so much sloppy code. We should always strive to write good clean code according to our understanding of the problem at the time. This will indeed help refactoring as our knowledge of the problem space grows.

## Git
Git is probably one of my favorite tools. Recently there was a [featured blog article](https://blog.plover.com/2022/06/29/#gt-sec2) about it that I thought was good, but the referenced [Git from the Bottom Up](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/) article is exceptional.
